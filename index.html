                <h1>Dear Nicolette, the love of my life,</h1>
                <p>It is with great pleasure that I write this to congratulate you on your success, and to give to
                    something to hold onto
                    and remind you whenever you are sad, down, or negative that your Ojay loves and will never forget
                    you.</p>
                <p>You are part of me, always and forever, through the thick and thin, good and bad moments. You
                    accepted and loved me
                    selflessly from the first day for who I am, at the same time going through a lot to keep us together
                    and happy, the
                    endless sacrifices, time, and emotional support you offered have overall made me a better person and
                    I am still
                    improving to be the best version of myself.</p>
                <p>We have gotten stronger and closer after several fights and disagreements, nothing can come between
                    us because we shall
                    always triumph. No distance is too far to get us apart because we have overcome everything that has
                    come our way and am
                    full of positivity that when you return, we shall still behaving each other.</p>
                <p>Onto your new step in your life, always pray, and ask God for his mercy, good health, and protection.
                    Always put in the
                    maximum effort and do your best as God helps those who help themselves. I am rooting for you to
                    complete it successfully
                    with excellence. I have my faith and trust in you. Whenever you feel like giving up, remember your
                    parents who have
                    invested a lot and supported you all through.</p>
                <p>When you are done with your next chapter, I will welcome you warmly and we can have each other
                    forever, doing all the
                    crazy things, we have always planned and nothing be against us then.</p>
                <p class="end">Love Ojay.</p>
